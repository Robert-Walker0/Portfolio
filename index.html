            <h2>Who is Robert?</h2>
            <p>Robert Walker is a 23-year-old developer interested in developing video games, software applications, art, AI, and technologically focused projects. These are his technical skills below: </p> 

            <p>Programming Languages: C++, Java, Python, Lua, and Javascript</p>
            <p>Web Technologies: HTML, CSS</p>
            <p>Additionally, he is interested in the video game series Monster Hunter and Pokemon and in storytelling.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He started learning to program in 2015 with Codeacademy with their HTML course. His first programming language however was C++ (which is extremely easy unlike what people say; if you learn it as your first language). He learned it back then with the use of SoloLearn, he stopped for a year after getting stuck on function arguments, but eventually came back and passed through it. Over these years, he did have a passion for development during these years however he did not start building well-defined projects until 2019.
            <br>

            <p>During the time frame of 2019 to the present, he has made a much more substantial impact on the amount of projects that he has completed (including this one). What he wants to achieve is to <b>make himself the best person that he can possibly be for now and in the future</b>. Because life is short, you can die anytime, anywhere, we must live our life to the fullest and never give up on our dreams. There are tons of people that believe in you whether you believe it or not, there is only one way to go and it is forwards.</p>

            <p>There are two philosophies that he believes make a well-defined developer that can tell a computer to do anything in the world. Both of those are the following quotes: </p>
            <blockquote>
                "You can only change yourself with one file at a time, programming, storywriting, excel, google docs, basic text files, or markdown files. If you want to change those, convert their empty presence into the ideals seen as valuable to your cause." <span>Robert Walker</span>
            </blockquote>    
            <blockquote>
                "Programming is akin to cooking, if you want to make a recipe, <b>you must identify the ingredients (the lines)</b>, but to identify the ingredients <b>you must take a look at the recipe (problem) as a whole before you start to cook</b>, useless you want to burn the kitchen." <span>Robert Walker</span>
            </blockquote>
